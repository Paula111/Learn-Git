    <h1>September Is a Dog's Dream</h2>
	<h2>BY MARILYN SINGER</h2>
	<p>September is a dog's dream
	the soft grass is growing
	the sweet breeze is blowing
	the air all full of singing feels just right
	so no excuses now</p>

	<p>we're going to the park
	to chase and charge and chew
	and I will make you see
	what spring is all about</p>
